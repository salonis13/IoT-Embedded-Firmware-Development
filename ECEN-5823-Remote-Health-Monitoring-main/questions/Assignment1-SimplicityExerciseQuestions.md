   Answer:


**2. How much current does the system draw (instantaneous measurement) when a single LED is on with the GPIO pin set to WeakAlternateWeak?**
   Answer:


**3. Is there a meaningful difference in current between the answers for question 1 and 2? Please explain your answer, 
referencing the [Mainboard Schematic](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/schematic-files/WSTK-Main-BRD4001A-A01-schematic.pdf) and [AEM Accuracy](https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/user-guides/ug279-brd4104a-user-guide.pdf) section of the user's guide where appropriate. Extra credit is avilable for this question and depends on your answer.**
   Answer:


**4. With the WeakAlternateWeak drive strength setting, what is the average current for 1 complete on-off cycle for 1 LED with an on-off duty cycle of 50% (approximately 1 sec on, 1 sec off)?**
   Answer:


**5. With the WeakAlternateWeak drive strength setting, what is the average current for 1 complete on-off cycle for 2 LEDs (both on at the time same and both off at the same time) with an on-off duty cycle of 50% (approximately 1 sec on, 1 sec off)?**
